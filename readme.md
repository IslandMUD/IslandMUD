**IslandMUD** is a free, open source Multi-User Dimension set on an expansive island in a medieval period. While your fellow players are on your side in your efforts to colonize a world inhabited by scattered pioneers, militants seek to purge this land of all colonists.

- Defend your settlements against coordinated attacks by NPCs.
- Ambush patrols, capture outposts, and invade fortresses.

**Your actions decide history**
- Factions grow and crumble as players gain and lose control of fortresses, mineral fields, and strategic locations.
- Fight in battles to protect your settlements or expand your empire.
- Players and NPCs can capture any structure or turn it to rubble.

- Complex blacksmithing system allowing for tools and weapons with unique properties
