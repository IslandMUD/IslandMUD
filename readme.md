**IslandMUD** is a free open source Multi-User Dimension in active development that takes place on an expansive procedurally generated island set in a medieval period. While your fellow players are on your side in your efforts to colonize a world inhabited only by scattered pioneers, militants seek to purge this land of all trace of colonists.

- Craft tools, weapons, huts, houses, outposts, or fortresses from the ground up with sandbox-esque freedom.
- Cooperate with your friends to defend your fledgling colonies against coordinated attacks by NPCs.
- Launch sneak attacks upon the enemies' structures.

**Nothing is set in stone**

- Every structure that is created whether by players or NPCs can be turned to rubble.
- Tools and weapons wear down, lose effectiveness, and break.
- NPCs barter based on (invisible) market prices as well as their current interests.

**Features**

- 600,000 rooms of biome-based wilderness
- Hostile NPCs as tough as any player
- Neutral NPCs scattering the world who barter for the right price
- Invisible classless skills system
- Crafting of tools, weapons, and structures
- Freedom to build, trade, explore, defend, attack, or raid
- Free, multiplayer, and open source

**Bring your friends. You can't take on IslandMUD alone.**
