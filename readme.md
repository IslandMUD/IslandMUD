**IslandMUD** is a free, open source Multi-User Dimension set on an expansive island in a medieval period. While your fellow players are on your side in your efforts to colonize a world inhabited by scattered pioneers, militants seek to purge the island of colonists.

- Construct huts, outposts, or fortresses with sandbox-esque freedom.
- Defend your settlements against coordinated attacks by NPCs.
- Ambush patrols, capture outposts, and invade fortresses.

**Your actions decide history**
- Factions grow and crumble as players gain and lose control of fortresses, mineral fields, and strategic locations.
- Fight in battles to protect your settlements or expand your empire.
- Players and NPCs can capture any structure or turn it to rubble.

**Features**
- 600,000 rooms of biome-based wilderness
- Classless and invisible skill leveling
- Intelligent and coordinating NPCs
- Neutral NPCs scattering the world who barter for the right price and offer quests
