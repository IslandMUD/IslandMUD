**IslandMUD** is a free open source Multi-User Dimension set on an expansive procedurally-generated island in a medieval period. While your fellow players are on your side in your efforts to colonize a world inhabited by scattered pioneers, militants seek to purge this land of all colonists.

- Craft tools, weapons, huts, houses, outposts, or fortresses from the ground up with sandbox-esque freedom.
- Cooperate with other players to defend your colonies large or small against coordinated attacks by NPCs.
- Turn the tables: ambush patrols, capture outposts, and launch attacks on enemy fortresses.

**Nothing is set in stone**
- Every structure that is created by players or NPCs can be turned to rubble.
- Tools and weapons wear down, lose effectiveness, and break.
- Neutral NPCs barter based on market prices and their own interests.

**Leveling**
- ...is classless, invisible, and gradient
- Abilities improve through use and decay over time
- Maxing a stat is a difference of x5, not x100 (new players are still crucial to the fight!)

**Features**
- 600,000 rooms of biome-based wilderness
- Hostile NPCs as tough as any player
- Neutral NPCs scattering the world who barter for the right price
- Allied PCs
- Crafting of tools, weapons, and structures
- Freedom to build, trade, explore, defend, attack, or raid
- Free, multiplayer, and open source

**Bring your friends. You can't take on IslandMUD alone.**
