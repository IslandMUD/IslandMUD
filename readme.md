IslandMUD

Jim Viebke, 2015

IslandMUD is a free opensource Multi-User Dimension that takes place on an expansive procedurally generated island set in a medieval period. While your fellow players may be on your side in your efforts to colonize a world inhabited only by scattered pioneers, militants seek to purge this land of all trace of colonists.

- Craft tools, weapons, huts, houses, outposts, or fortresses from the ground up with sandbox-esque freedom.
- Cooperate with your friends to defend your fledgling colonies against coordinated attacks by NPCs.
- Launch sneak attacks upon the enemys' structures.

Features:

- 600,000 rooms of biome-based wilderness
- Hostile NPCs who are as tough as any player
- Indifferent NPCs scattering the world who will barter for the right price
- Invisible classless skills system
- Crafting of tools, weapons, and structures
- Freedom to build, trade, explore, defend, attack, or raid
- Free, multiplayer, and opensource

Bring your friends. You can't take on IslandMUD alone.
