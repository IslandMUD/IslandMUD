This is a test.

For some reason, downsizing the world dimensions then restarting the server results in an empty world. (?!)
	I suspect this is because world.load() attempts to load the terrain file and correctly fails when it can't, but it
	makes no attempt to load the biome_map. Try perform the same load-then-verify then save-or-recreate as we do for the world_terrain file.

There's no way to tell if a room is water or not. One could use distance from island radius, but this is
	highly subject to off-by-one errors. A room needs to have `bool water;` which is loaded and unloaded from disk

Draw water as ~ just using the center tile

Add followers feature, so each character has follower_IDs and following_ID, which are mutually exclusive.
In player->move manually move all IDs when the leader moves.
If a player is following an player who isn't signed in, clear following string
If a player tries to move while following, block it.
	follow [name]
	unfollow (2nd arg is optional and ignored)


taking a second branch: "you now have a branch" (need a smarter message)

Implement ladders/stairs/ramp

Give certain hierarchies of items a quality. Basic items will be crude.
-- How will this work? "craft crude bow", "craft nice bow", "craft great bow". "Crude" works, "nice" and "great" don't.

The current return for crafting or aquiring is: "You now have a(n) " + craft_item_id
If the item was yielded, it would be nice if it said "You now have a(n) branch from the tree."

Item wear. A sword wears with every strike, a bow with every fire, an axe with every strike.
	While fighing: "You notice your sword [shows use]/[has become mildly worn]/[has become worn]/[is slightly damaged]/[is damaged]/[is badly damaged]/[is damaged beyond use]."
	While offering: "[name] presents/offers a sword that [is mildly worn]".
	While equipping: "You draw a [mildy-worn] axe."
	While returning to inventory: "You sheath your [well-worn] sword."
There could be an item_condition object that accepts items by constant reference and returns a string description based on its wear.
	It could also accept an enum to represent the context (fighting, offering, equipping, unequipping)

Random country folk who craft tools or grow crops.
Each NPC could have between 1-3 occupations. Others would specialize (blacksmithing).
This would make development of AI easier - no need to balance NPC situational improvement with combat yet.

When someone performs an action, everyone around/observing that individual would have to be notified of it.

Security issue for later: user validation / pw encryption
